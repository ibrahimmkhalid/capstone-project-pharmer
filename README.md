_Precision Home Agriculture and Refined Market Evaluation Resource_


![Project poster image](./assets/poster.jpg)

A comprehensive smart farming system developed as a capstone project,
integrating IoT, mobile applications, and machine learning to enable precision
agriculture for home and small-scale farming operations.

## Overview

P.H.A.R.M.E.R is an intelligent agricultural automation platform that combines
real-time sensor monitoring, automated actuation, mobile control, and
predictive analytics to optimize crop growth and yield. The system features a
multi-tier architecture with embedded controllers, a cross-platform mobile app,
and a web-based ML platform for data-driven farming decisions.
